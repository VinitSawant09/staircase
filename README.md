Staircase problem solution - a pet project to demonstrate technology experience in Java8, Spring Boot, Rest etc.

Problem Statement- 

A stairwell has a number of flights of stairs separated by landings.
Each flight is a straight line of steps that you can climb without stopping.  One can
stride more than one step at a time when climbing each flight.
It takes two strides to turn on the landing and start again on the next flight of stairs.
As input, you are given an array listing the number of steps in each flight of stairs in the stairwell. One can also
receive the number of steps you can cover with each stride (you could climb 2 steps per stride, or 3 steps per
stride if you were tall and fit).
The stairwell has between 1 and 30 flights inclusive. Each flight can have a maximum of 20 steps. You can
stride between 1 and 4 steps inclusive.
For a given input, the minimum number of strides necessary to get to the top of the stairwell have been evaluated.
